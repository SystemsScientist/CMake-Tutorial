# CMake Tutorial - CMake for Cross-Platform Project Build

This repository contains .cpp, .o, header, and make files
for a tutorial on how to write, modularize, compile,
and build executables for a partial calculator program.

I used C++ and Vim on a Fedora 36 system in a VirtualBox
environment to create and manage these directories and
their respective files.

Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any 
questions or comments. In addition, feel free to utilize
these files and reference the CMake Tutorial on Udemy.com
The course is called 'Master CMake for Cross-Platform C++
Project Building'.
